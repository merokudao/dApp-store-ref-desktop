The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Adding new API endpoints

While adding new API endpoints it is important to call `api.injectEndpoints` and register the builder function with
Redux Toolkit an example of this can be seen in `src/features/dapp/dapp_api.ts`
